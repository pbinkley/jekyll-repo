# jekyll-repo
Use jekyll to generate a static html version of a repository of pdfs

The idea is to create a static html site that can be viewed and navigated on local storage rather than requiring a server, 
from a set of pdfs described in a Solr index (or another sources of csv). The purpose is to make a repository project that is 
built with current software tools (which will become obsolete and require maintenance by someone with technical skills) into 
a static site that requires only that it be copied to new media before the old media becomes unreadable.
